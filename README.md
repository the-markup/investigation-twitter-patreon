Markup readers helped uncover the link delays, which also affect WhatsApp and Messenger. Read the [full story](https://themarkup.org/news/2023/10/16/twitter-is-throttling-patreon-links-creators-say-it-undermines-their-livelihood).


# Methodology
In September, [The Markup reported](https://themarkup.org/investigations/2023/09/15/twitter-is-still-throttling-competitors-links-check-for-yourself) that Twitter, now officially named X, was slowing down links to Bluesky, Facebook, Instagram, and Substack, also by an average of 2.5 seconds, which can feel extremely slow for users. We simultaneously launched a [tool](https://themarkup.org/investigations/2023/09/15/twitter-is-still-throttling-competitors-links-check-for-yourself) that lets readers test any link posted on X (which the platform automatically shortens using the t.co domain), and measured the time it took for X to redirect the link to its original destination. The Markup also built a bot that would let us know if any links readers were testing appeared to be throttled.

Shortly after publication, readers began [using our tool](https://twitter.com/dancow/status/1705288111326990701), and we received alerts that Patreon, WhatsApp, and Messenger links appeared to be throttled. To confirm these findings, we created new links and measured over several days the performance of redirects to the [25 top-earning Patreon campaigns](https://graphtreon.com/top-patreon-earners), as measured by tracking site Graphtreon on September 30.

During that time, we also tested 25 randomly selected recently tweeted links to both WhatsApp and Messenger. With the exception of six Messenger links that do not seem to be throttled, we consistently found the same 2.5-second slowdown. We do not know why most, but not all, links to Messenger’s m.me domain are throttled.

This file contains a summary of our test results, grouped by the unique 75 t.co links in our test pool.

We have redacted the t.co and exapnded URLs for Whatsapp links, as they contained phone numbers.
